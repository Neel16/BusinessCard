# PCB business card.

I saw a friend make a business card on PCB once. I thought "What a great way to stand out". 

So i asked him How i could go about designing one of my own. The designing software i used is Eagle by AutoDesk.

The card has a small prototyping area where we can solder some small components to make a useful circuit. 

I ordered the PCBs using JLCPCB and decided to go with white soldermask and black silkscreen for the letters on the top layer.

## Future Scope

I might add a small type c to USB converter since the components are fairly cheap and i wont go broke while ordering a ton of 

these.
